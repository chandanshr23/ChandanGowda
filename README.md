# Coding Test Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a simple coding test with 4 problems. Each problem is implemented in a separate file. The test allows solutions in any programming language.

## Repository Structure

- Problem1.java — Solution to Problem 1  
- Problem2.java — Solution to Problem 2  
- Problem3.java — Solution to Problem 3  
- Problem4.java — Solution to Problem 4  

## Coding Language

All solutions are implemented in Java.

## Instructions Followed

1. Create a Public GitHub Repository  
2. Create new files for each problem. (For example: If you take the test in python, there should be 3 files, Program-1.py, Program-2.py and Program-3.py)  
3. The test can be taken in "any programming language". Please mention coding language and comments in the README file.  
4. Add your GitHub repository link to section-1 of the Google form [ https://forms.gle/sinyNtXpUo2dNwzC8 ] once you've finished coding.  
5. There are 4 Simple Questions in this Test, which would take no more than 60 minutes to solve.
